# Recitation Exercise \#5

In this recitation exercise, you'll explore the computational complexity of dynamic array insertion.  You can compile this code using the provided makefile:
```
make
```

There's also a little script included that will use Gnuplot to plot a TSV file as a line graph.  This script may come in handy to help analyze some of the timing information you generate in this exercise.  You can run the script like this after setting the variables `INFILE` and `OUTFILE` in the script itself to the filenames for the input TSV file and the output JPEG file, respectively:
```
./generate_plot_from_tsv
```

Note that the plotting script assumes that [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) is installed and available on your machine.  It should already be installed on the ENGR servers, if you're working there.
